# This function will take the prior probability that each of the 
# three possible suspects (X, J, and O (other)) are guilty as a named 
# list `p` when the names are X, J, and O respectively.
# Additionally, it will take the likelihood, `l`, that a given piece of 
# evidence is true given that a given suspect is guilty. This 
# should also be given as a named list with the same names 
# (X, J, O) as p. 
# This will return a named list by the same convention 
# with the posterior probabilites of guilt for each of the three
# suspects
