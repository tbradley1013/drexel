# Lecture 1 (4/4/2019) - Perfluoroinated Compounds

## Intro
  * Not a "yesterday" issue, it is a "today" issue
  * USEPA has established the health advisory levels for PFOA and PFAS at 70 ppt of combined Pf
  * PFOA and PFOS found in >90% of human blood around the world
  * found everywhere in the environment
  
    * Water 
    
      * surface and ground water
    
    * Landfill leachates
    * Consumer products (i.e. clothes, automobiles, carpets)
    * food
    
    * We will mainly focus on water and landfill leachates
  
  * The relevance in grounwater is mainly from firefighting operations
  * PFCs were designed to be non-reactive even at over 1000 \degC and are designed to be highly soluble in water
  * Litigation has focused on PFOA and PFOS but there are 1000s of potential compounds (~5000)
  * PFOA and PROS are both 8 carbon compounds 
  
    * They are the backbone compounds for the PFCs
    * To get the other contaminants, more carbon and fluoride ions are added onto these compounds
    
  * Water treatment foesnt remove these compounds from water
  * They are very inert, don't react, and are called "forever chemicals"
  * The chemicals have a three year half life. 
  
  
## Damages
  
  * Currently between 215 and 1500 impacted facilities that may have PFCs
  * New Jersey places regulatory level of 12 ppt as an MCL
  * Cost analysis 
    
    * **sampling and analysis** alone will cost millions of dollars
    * **Captial cost** To install GAC at these facilites could cost roughly 294M-2B dollars for 215-1500 facilites
    * **Operations and Maintenance** can cost in the hundreds of millions a year for this number of facilites
    
  * The main expected health issues are developmental diseases
  
    * The chemicals pass the placenta and are passed onto children from their mothers
    * They are biochemically active
    * They can minic portions of the male reproductive system and can cause issues (i.e. it is an active agent in the male testoterone systems which effects development)
    * It is potentially a carcinogenic
    * It is potentially harmful at three orders of magnitude lower than previously expected
    * There are not solid answers, but significant bioaccumulation occurs in the liver, even though it is processed by the kidney. They are stored in blood and not in fat cells
